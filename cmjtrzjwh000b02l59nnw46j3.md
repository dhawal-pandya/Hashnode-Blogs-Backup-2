> “May you live in interesting times.” - Chinese curse.

Are you successful?

This question puts everyone on guard. It is an implied boolean question, so you can only answer “yes” or “no”, and whatever side your answer leans towards, your brain will conjure up arguments to pull you to the other side. As you keep reading, I want you to keep this question in the back of your mind.

On my first day at my first job, I would have answered with an unequivocal “Yes!” to this question. I had just got a job. From the sea of unemployed “youth”, a bubble had arisen to be higher than the rest, to join into the infinite journey towards the sky. But my bubble had never arisen before. Before this time, I had never been employed. It’s not that I had never worked, of course I had, but to work for money, that too as an employee was the first time. It might be surprising for many, but in the very beginning, I actually felt guilty for taking the money for my work. I did not even negotiate my salary past asking for it. I thought I was going to learn so much, and have access to such a wide code base, learn so much new tech, all for not only free, but would be paid to learn it. I would be able to get great PR reviews from “actual” developers, and sharpen my skills so much, I would be unrecognizable. It was a dream come true.

On my first day, I started something I called the “Victory Sheet” where I would keep adding all the new things I would learn across my professional journey. It earlier just looked like “HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, TailwindCSS, ReactJS,…”, but then eventually, I would add things like “Implemented Google Sign In”, or “Learned DB sharding”.

I was on probation for 2 months, and in that time both the company and I would decide if this collaboration was indeed good for both of us. The founders, the only other folks in the company btw, decided we needed more devs. I was hired as a “FullStack Developer”, but all I knew really, all I was proficient at was Frontend. I had reached that part of the Dunning-Kruger graph, where I thought I know everything about frontend, and could make whatever was expected of me. So naturally, two more frontend folks were hired. The “probation” game was not exactly useful, so from the time those two guys were taken in, they were taken in full time, and I was also made a FTE (full-time employee) along with them. Before the decided 2 months ended, on a Monday morning stand up, one of the founders asked me if I had ever worked on Backend. I answered honestly that I had not, at least not to this scale. There was a time once where I had built a Python based CRUD application, but that was too ugly for me to be mentioned again. He told me to learn Golang, and ping him once I was done with it, as I would be moving to the Backend side of things. My Frontend tasks were quickly reassigned and I was left alone with no tasks for the next few days.

How does one learn “Backend”? How does one decide that he knows a language? I was about to anyway fall down my Valley of Despair, when I was plunged into another Void of Ignorance. To be honest, I was also very excited, because like I said, I was already convinced that there was nothing more to be learned in Frontend. I started learning Golang, and also started making a mental map full of black boxes. I did not know how routes worked, I just knew this is the way they are written, so if I have to write routes, this is the way I shall write. And I would move on. Once I had the position of all the black boxes roughly figured out, only then I would move in to an individual black box, and see how it was written. Moving to Go was also very fascinating. Because of compile time type-safety, I rarely had to go inside functions and read them to know what they were doing. Go was cool. Go was fast, and it was esoteric enough that I could become the Go guy in our company and also in the company of my friends who were mostly devs themselves. Now I too had something to say about a language only a few of them knew. I absorbed Go into me so fully that even to this day, I am the Go guy to my mates. Before the end of the week, I had already pushed code for review, and it was live in production over the weekend. I had once again gone from knowing “diddly” to directly writing production code within a week, in a language whose existence itself was not known to me prior.

During my initial days as a Backend dev, I would also help out in the Frontend work, because it was still my first language. There we had to implement something called an “Accordion”. I had previously implemented it in one of my pet projects, so I picked up that task assuming all I would have to do would be to just copy paste the implementation. I opened up my repo with the hope of logging out early that day, and I was stunned. I would have vomited. Oh my god, was my code garbage! Absolute shit! I was thoroughly ashamed to think that I was once proud of this code. I had named the variables using marvel characters, and some other temporary ones using bad-words. I had no sense of single responsibility in my functions, and I had in some places copied pieces of functions, and in some places called the functions themselves. I would rather type the code from scratch on a keyboard made of nails, before copy anything from that monstrosity into my codebase. I completed the task, but that feeling did not leave me alone. I went back and forth across several of my old projects I had made while learning. All of them put me in shame. I realized I was not happy with a single one of my projects, including the ones I had put in my resume, the ones that got me the “job”. Even the recent ones.

I started feeling unworthy of the role. I thought I was duping these kind folks who had taken a bet on me. I looked back to my Victory Sheet, and that gave me no solace either. Did I really “learn how to write JS functions”? All the things I had written, were very superficial, and I could conjure up so many questions regarding each of them, because I knew where my lacunae existed. I knew all the holes in my knowledge. I made a new friend called anxiety who would sit next to me during the daily stand up, and I would try to over-commit, so as to hide my real incompetence. My friend would not leave me, and would be only quiet when I was working, so I just kept working. I used to work across 10 - 12 hours daily, rewriting code, trying to be good, trying to be worthy. Not only was I unsuccessful, I also a liar.

One day I got assigned a task of integrating a payment gateway in the Backend, and that just sent me. It was a big task, and almost 2 weeks were assigned for its completion. I thought yeah, this would be it. This is how they find out, just how big of a cheater I am and promptly say “Sayonara” to me. I read, reread their documentation thoroughly multiple times. I implemented the stage functionality, and tested it with dummy money. I actually implemented it like 3 times, with increasing levels of abstractness, so that eventually to add a new payment gateway would be easy, and config based. Eventually during low traffic hours, late at night, I even tested it in production, then quickly rolled it back before anyone could use it. I was very scared when I raised that PR, because I was obviously going to get sacked based of it. I was thinking should I note down the PR number, so I know what my unlucky number is. The next day at the stand up I was silent until spoken to. When asked, I just said, i completed it, and the PR was in review. My manager told me, that he had checked out the PR at night itself, and was already merged to main, and would be deployed over the weekend. I actually asked him if he even read my code, because how can a dumbass like me write such an important piece of code. He just told me, that the code was all good, he had even commented the glorious “LGTM” on it before merging. When I told him that I had never interacted with this kind of code before, and this was the first time I had did it, I even told him the way I had incrementally tested and eventually raised the PR, he actually said “good job”. Good job? Me? Had he not seen what a dumbass I was while writing the code for that “Accordion”. Had he not seen the countless mistakes I had made across all my projects, which I was too ashamed to even see? Probably not, because here he was, saying “good work”. My mind was just blown.

Eventually down the line while discussing this with my friend Viral, I learned about something called “Imposter Syndrome” and “God Complex”. He told me that most developers lay somewhere between these two extremes. I told him I was the pendulum of a metronome that pointed to both of them periodically. These waves kept coming, but the amplitude of these waves eventually got lower and lower. My other friend who used to sit with me in the daily stand up, had now been more and more frequently absent as well.

We, developers at my company, were a very closely knit team, so at all times, all of us were aware of what each of us was working on. We experienced our sad days together more often than not. On one such day when we were all in the depths of our despair, we got the news that we would be getting work laptops. I was a real newbie, I did not even know that we were supposed to get work laptops on the day we joined, so when it was announced, I got really happy. To add as a cherry on cake, it was announced we would be getting Macbooks.

Now to the folks already reading this on their Apple devices, it may not seem like much, but there was a visible shift in view people had of me when I told them I was getting a Macbook. Macbooks are the subtle humble brags developers have. I cannot presume to be immune to it. I had friends working on multiple other OS, and work as they are brilliantly, but a Macbook is a Macbook!. It means you “made” it.

Since then I have become both more foolish and wiser simultaneously, I now know that it was merely vanity, but under the veil of being successful. Still at that time I came out of my depression quickly being pulled on my Unix.

I never really stopped learning. CS was very cool to me. Every time I faced a technical issue, I would learn how some genius had bypassed it. For example, we do not measure the average latency of a server, but the p99 or the p95. This is far more useful, but deeply unintuitive at first. There were many such ideas that gave me genuine “aha” moments. Another was the assignment-in-condition trap. I started writing code defensively with that in mind, only to later learn that Go simply does not allow this class of mistake. So why had I internalized it so strongly? It turned out to be inherited knowledge, something my lead had learned from C++ during his CS education and carried forward as a reflex.

That was an important realization for me. People with strong CS backgrounds were not some bias-free logic machines. They, too, carried redundant beliefs and historical baggage. Around the same time, another feeling started creeping in: code was hackable. Many solutions that once felt clever began to look like hacks when I revisited them months later. I deliberately resisted over-indexing on that thought, because with enough cynicism, everything can be reduced to a hack. But as long as I kept learning, I felt I was still doing what I had come here to do.

…

Our company had run out of funds 8 months after I joined. All of us were expecting raises on the day the news was broken to us. The founders told that there was some “investor” whose money was stuck, and so in a few days the money would be released, and asked all of us to bear with them. The few days turned into few weeks, which turned into few months. Work is infinite, so it never really got over, but there was no pay. The folks had also convinced us that we were not *that* good, so actually expecting better pay elsewhere was also not going to fly.

I was still learning new things. I had got to the point where I could design and code a fully functioning product within 3 weeks. I built an event management product, which was essentially a ticket booking web app. A user could set up a venue, shows, with tickets of different prices and capacity, and then publicize the event using our link on which people could come in, explore, buy the ticket, and watch the show on a QR code generated info page. Our pay was not good to begin with, and it was non-existent for the last 3 months. I was also passively looking for jobs elsewhere. Eventually the lack of pay had soured our relations with the founders, because I feel that they could have been more open and honest with us. I felt that the responsibility of coding the products was with us engineers, which we delivered, but the responsibility of making it successful was not in our ambit.

Anyways, on such a sour day, I got a call from a recruiter for a job I had not applied for. I had almost said no to them, but I just told them, I was busy and would contact them back later. Truth was I did not recognize the name of the company, so I put it out of my mind.

Viral and I play chess, and have been playing chess since we were in college. There are easily more than thousands of games played between us. I wont be enumerating the benefits of chess, because the usual reasons do not apply to us. I play it mainly because it gives me time to spend with my friend. Anyway, I must mention that he is a far better engineer than me, and has already worked for FAANG companies. His opinion on CS related stuff is gospel for me, even though I am a Hindu. So, while checkmating him, I just told him about the recruiter and the name of the company, in the sense that, see, even small companies like *that* one was approaching me. I said that with a sense of air, as if my then current company was not going out of business as we spoke. After a pause of 2 seconds, and a subsequent barrage of slurs to me, Viral educated me that, that company was the biggest fintech company of India, and I was an idiot to ignore them. He suggested me to call them back immediately after our game, and set up the interviews.

Well long story short, I got selected there, and had to move to Pune for work. Was I not successful? If you observe I still did not have any negotiating power, because any salary they promised was more than 0, my then current salary. I had no moral high ground, nor was I convinced of my skills, so I just accepted their offer only because my bubble had come very close to bursting. A sudden gust of wind, and I was propelled upwards. My salary had doubled, which meant either folks from my previous company were lying, or these newer folks had too much money to spare. I decided I did not like thinking about it.

Here I got a real team. There were more than 1000 employees in that company, and more than 15 in my team, under my manager (3x more than the total people in my previous company). I got a good sense of scale as well. I met a lot of engineers with very varied experiences, and such that my Victory Sheet looked stupid to me.

They had sent a flight ticket for me to come to Pune, I told them I could just come in a train, but they had already bought the ticket, and sent it my way. I had to tell them that the nearest airport from my village was around 100km away, and above all this I had never travelled in a plane before. All the HR had to say to that was “All the best!” in the driest voice she could muster before she hung up. I was 5 again when I flew. I didn’t even know the proper vocabulary. I used to keep saying that my plane was on so on date and I had to catch my plane. This was until my mom corrected me to say “flight”, not “plane”. Well once my flight took off, and I saw the clouds from above for the first time, I was very, very happy. It was surprisingly exactly how I imagined it to be. I travelled in a plane for the first time, was I not successful then?

The new office was also very posh. I was assigned the desk with number C - 32, which was basically in the middle of the giant room filled with rows of desks neatly arranged. I was not directly assigned my seat on my first day, but I did meet my manager then. I was introduced to my team, and he had told me to attend meetings without cause just to absorb the ways of the company. He was very kind to me, and always helped me out. But here’s the thing that always nagged me. His seat number was C - 31. He used to sit next to me. He was mostly busy with his own meetings, and other calls, but whenever there was some time to kill, I was asked on updates, not necessarily asked for completions, just updates. In my first company, the Backend lead was also the co-founder, and it would be a busy fortnight, if I had to speak with him more than once. Usually we communicated asynchronously, and so I really never had to be managed really. In fact, in the very beginning, it was a gripe of mine that my lead trusted me too much. He would just assign a task to me, and ask me to figure it out, that’s it. No help. He was a very firm believer of learning on the job, too firm some might say. Coming from that to sitting next to the manager daily, was a welcome but interesting change of pace.

My team was also very varied, most of the folks were local, meaning from Pune, including my manager, but there were also some very learned folks in our team. I used to be very proud of the fact that there were many engineers around me from reputed colleges like NITs and similar colleges, and I had made it till here, on my own without any formal training.

Some things can never really be taught, like enjoying tea. Me and my father have a saying amongst each other that if you ever say no to an invitation to tea, the Gods will send to back to Earth. To avoid *this* reason for reincarnation, always go with the tea. I applied that to the most excellent effect. I went with my colleagues for tea almost daily, and the unimportant conversations that happened there laid the foundations of some of my better friendships. I don’t drink tea when it is too hot, so it happened that I was usually the last guy to drink. To avoid the awkward awaiting, I would also pay for the tea whenever I could without protest, unlike any of the other folks who did argue on that, sometimes even on my behalf. But that tea time I had with my friends was one of the highlights of my time there. I wonder if success can be measured by the quality of the company I keep.

My assigned buddy was a very senior engineer, and a very hard worker. He had little patience to teach me the ways of our product, and I would unintentionally annoy him by asking some basic questions regarding our product. He also had a flair to surprise, and so many of his definitions, his suggestions, all felt like unnecessary riddles that I had to debug to understand what he meant. This was fine in the beginning because I had no idea what the SDLC was, or how things were done here, but to test my nerves the Gods had decided that I had been enough happy for some time, and my life needed to change. I was assigned On-Call duties from my second week itself. I was barely aware of our product, and the alerts, I was not even given owner access to our repo, nor rights to deploy our changes to production, but I was expected to “solve” any issues that arose during the On-Call period. I would keep asking for help, but there was no formal document, until I started it. Every time I got an alert, I would look at the logs, and figure out why an alert came, and started documenting it. Some alerts came at night as well, way into the night. I had no body to call to, and my immediate teammates did not pick up the call, because it wasn’t their On-Call week. Across my stay at this company, this aspect of On-Call never changed, and no amount of help would get this ghost off me.

The office hours were fine, but at home I would be alone. I used to video call my parents daily, but once that call got over, I was silent. Weekends were worse, there is not a lot to do for a single guy at home, and I had done enough work during the week to work again. This city was also new to me, so I would go for long bike rides late at night. Sometimes, even that was not an option, if you know Pune city, you know what it means to be in traffic. All this slowly slowly sucked at my soul.

Then came the change of guard. My previous manager, a man of silent trust, departed, and in his wake entered a regime of noise. Unfortunately for everyone involved, my new manager was also a new manager, and like every new manager, his instinct to fix things was directed to things that were working just fine. More and more things started breaking in the pipeline after he entered the picture.

I learned the dark side of Order. It was not the Order that liberates; it was the Order that suffocates. The workplace transformed from a studio of creation into a courtroom of constant defense. Where once I was given a problem and left alone to resolve it, now I was now placed under a microscope.

The days of 'learning on the job' were replaced by the days of 'extinguishing fires.' We ceased to be architects and became firefighters, yet the arsonist was often the manager himself. Every deadline was halved by adding a new engineer, based on the some esoteric arithmetic. My teammates even suggested that under this guy, nine women could indeed produce a baby in one month if only they coordinated better.

My code, once a source of pride, became a subject of suspicion. Solutions I crafted were dismissed as 'hacks' not because they didn't work, but because they didn't fit a rigid, aesthetic template held in my manager’s mind. To an artist, being told your brushstrokes are wrong by someone who isn't holding a brush cuts deep. Every time a solution was suggested by us, he would keep saying that it might work as a hack for now, we will have to rewrite the whole thing later. Now, I must confess, he too was a very competent engineer, and I had days when I had to reach out to him for ideas, but that was part of the problem. He was a very good engineer, that’s it.

To 'fix' this perceived incompetence, the upper management tightened its grip. We were forced to write 'One-Pagers', describing our solutions and get it peer-reviewed before we were even allowed to code it. An AI system was brought in to score us, which would look at the one-pagers and our PRs, and assign some score to us. I scored well, but the victory was hollow. I was winning a game I never wanted to play. No fires came down.

My old friend Anxiety returned, no longer whispering this time but screaming. I found myself working 14-hour days, not out of the 'flow' I had felt in my early coding days, but out of a desperate need to prove I wasn't the imposter they treated me as. I watched the calendar pages turn, and for the first time in my career, I realized I had not updated my 'Victory Sheet' for a month.

I had stopped learning. I had only started surviving. The discord I felt years ago in that exam hall, the gap between what I was doing and who I was, had returned. I was no longer a Software Engineer; I was a clerk who knew how to type syntax.

I deliberated about this with many friends and senior colleagues, and most of them told me to apply elsewhere, and resign only once I have an offer from somewhere else. But what was happening was, there was no breathing space. Multiple interviews that I had scheduled with other companies had to be postponed, due to some emergency in our system then. I had even used my paid leaves for the same, but still I was expected to work on my leave days, because it was “urgent”. I even found myself reeling away from my laptop, and stay away from coding, even though that was the one thing I loved about being an engineer.

I put in my papers without a backup. I simply walked out of the fire and into the cool air. It was the eighth day of Navratri, a time of victory of good over evil, and I felt a quiet victory of my own. I didn't feel dread, I felt like a fish returned to the ocean.

I was ready to struggle again, but the Universe, it seems, has a wicked sense of humor. Just as I prepared for a long winter of unemployment, a call came from the ether. A recruiter for a company I hadn’t heard of, offering a role I hadn’t chased. I remembered Viral’s advice ‘*listen before you speak’* and I took the call.

It was a US-based MNC. They didn't care about my seat number, my 'one-pagers,' or my 'time-in-seat.' They cared about the code. The interview process was swift, devoid of any theatrical bureaucracy I had grown to loathe. I was hired as an L4 engineer for their US team. The salary was double what I had left behind.

The irony was not lost on me. I had spent years trying to climb the ladder in the cities, Pune, Bangalore, chasing the 'professional' life. And now, the biggest leap of my career allowed me to return exactly where I started. I would be working for a Silicon Valley company from my village in Valsad.

I realized then that the 'bubble' I was so worried about riding or bursting didn't matter. I had stepped out of the bubble entirely and planted my feet on the ground.

On the day after December 21st, the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, I began my new journey. It felt fitting. I had survived the long darkness of my own doubt, and the sun was finally starting its return. Sol Invictus indeed.

Now, I sit at Tithal Beach. The black sand is warm beneath my feet, and the waves of the ocean itself are my screensaver. I open my laptop under the shade of an umbrella. I write code. I drink tea.

Am I successful? I don't know, and for the first time in my life, I don't care. I am at peace. And perhaps, in this study of time, that is the only metric that counts.

Are you at peace?
