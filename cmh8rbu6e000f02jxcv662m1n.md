Let me write a rhyme today,  
Some painter has colored me so.  
Who dares to love in this world?  
So fast it moves, and me so slow.

The world seems fake and faker still,  
Who can trust these words again?  
Anyone can now fashion poems,  
No one knows, through prompt or pain.

These beauties I see around me so,  
Are the distractions of a temple wall.  
They lure the ego and keep it out,  
No man unturned and made a thrall.

But the one who dares to enter,  
Sees the world in the womb right there,  
We pray to her with joined hands,  
She showers on us, her love and care.

\----

Let me explain my affliction,  
I do not know where to look.  
No one to guide me, through the plane,  
No answer found in any book.  

I do not know how to look for love,  
I do not know what to look for,  
I do not know if is it time,  
And yet I brave this unknown war.  

I do find someone colorful,  
And yet I fear if it is even true,  
I don't want to impose myself,  
But I believe in true love too.  

What should I say, to begin the talk?  
All I can think of, is her praise,  
But empty it feels when I say it to her,  
And silence there is for days and days.

\----

Shallow talk is not for me.  
I wish to converse for ten thousand years,  
To hold her hand, and soul in mine,  
Till the end of time appears.  

If I must, then I will be alone,  
If that is the will of Gods for me,  
But I don't think that is the case,  
Or I wouldn't be writing this poetry.  

So I don't know if it is right,  
But I must forgo these temple walls,  
And take the steps inside the stones,  
Or willingly succumb to these calls.  

I'd love to explore the vast cosmos,  
Within and without, I guarantee,  
All I ask, is for your colorful hands,  
Will you, in love, be joining me?
